# EvolvingNeuralNetwork
This project contains a simple implementation of evolving neural networks through random mutations in c#. 
The neural network is used a the brain for birds which learn to fly through an obstacle course. 
Feel free to use this Unity project for your own fun.

# Assets
I downloaded the game background from https://opengameart.org/content/game-background-forest, it is published under the CC0 license.
All other scripts and assets are created by myself. I appreciate if you credit me and I'm interested to see your projects if this one inspired you.

Many thanks
